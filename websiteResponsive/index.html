          Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character
          traits. There are many debates about its precise definition, for
          example, about which aims it tries to achieve. A further issue is
          whether part of the meaning of education is that the change in the
          student is an improvement. Some researchers stress the role of
          critical thinking to distinguish education from indoctrination. These
          disagreements affect how to identify, measure, and improve forms of
          education. The term can also refer to the mental states and qualities
          of educated people. Additionally, it can mean the academic field
          studying education.

          There are many types of education. Formal education happens in a
          complex institutional framework, like public schools. Non-formal
          education is also structured but happens outside the formal schooling
          system. Informal education is unstructured learning through daily
          experiences. Formal and non-formal education are divided into levels.
          They include early childhood education, primary education, secondary
          education, and tertiary education. Other classifications focus on the
          teaching method, like teacher-centered and student-centered education.
          Forms of education can also be distinguished by subject, like science
          education, language education, and physical education.

          The main field investigating education is called education studies. It
          examines what education is and what aims it has. It also studies how
          it happens, what effects it has, and how to improve it. It has many
          subfields, like philosophy of education, psychology of education,
          sociology of education, economics of education, and comparative
          education. It also discusses the history of education. In prehistory,
          education happened informally through oral communication and
          imitation. With the rise of ancient civilizations, writing was
          invented, and the amount of knowledge grew. This caused a shift from
          informal to formal education. Initially, formal education was mainly
          available to elites and religious groups. The invention of the
          printing press in the 15th century made books more widely available.
          This increased general literacy. Beginning in the 18th and 19th
          centuries, public education became more important. It led to the
          worldwide process of making primary education available to all, free
          of charge, and compulsory up to a certain age.
